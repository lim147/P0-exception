Project Proposal 4/4: Great to see that you included correctness assertions in the proposal. It would be acceptable to have only a single implicit exception type, it is up to you if you like to distinguish exception types. It is great that you consider both implicitly and explicitly raising an exception. Include in your result the translation scheme, as we had it for other P0 constructs.
